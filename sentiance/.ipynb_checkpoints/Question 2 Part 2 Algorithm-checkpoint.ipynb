    "The problem presented has been previously worked as known by this blog. How do we extract meaningful insight out of unlabeled data?\n",
    "https://www.sentiance.com/2018/01/29/unlabeled-visits/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Since the type of place a user is currently visiting highly depends on his recent and long-term past behavior, this kind of data needs to be gathered in a realistic setting where the temporal behavior of the user actually corresponds to natural human behavior.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand a location we must first put into context the past and recent user behaviour with the place. I first try to work with the data given, and extract new features out of this. Let's first try to understand two columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "start_time(YYYYMMddHHmmZ), duration(ms)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were given the start_time and duration, then we can infer many things. First we can infer, the day of the week of the location. This is shown in my day_of_the_week method, where I use python's datetime library to build a date time object that has the ability to infer the day of the week. This is important as a venue visited during a work day could entail a much different story than a venue during a weekend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another tool used is to figure how time is spent during \"sleeping\" or working hours. The method \"work_sleep\" which takes as input (hour,duration_hours,day_of_the_week). Imagine someone comes home at 11pm and stays there until 3pm on a Monday Night. We can consider this as the following. Let's say \"sleep hours are between 12am - 6am. Let's also consider work hours are between 9am-5pm. The user has \"slept\" for 6 hours and worked from home for 6 hours (9pm-3pm). This contextualizes that this place although may likely be a work location; it is most likely a home location.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, I would like to talk about algorithms and features that were considered but not used. Since, the data is unlabeled it may be thought to use unsupervised methods such as k-means. However, since the data has many noisy points, the labels will be mostly concentrated around non work and non home locations. To work around this, I have chosen to label home locations from person1 and person2. The labeling choice is to look at how many hours they spend \"sleeping\" in a location and then label it as home or not home. This is done in the \"home_labels\" method.\n",
    "The idea is use these \"sparse labels\" to train a logistic regression classifier on it and then predict on person3.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is encapsulated in our dfFactory class.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can rebuild our dataframe shown below. This uses a \"factory\" design pattern.\n",
