    "- For question 1 and 2, \n",
    "    - write production-ready code using OOP when relevant.\n",
    "    - create simple unit tests for your code where applicable.\n",
    "    - add comments and documentation strings for important methods. \n",
    "    - discuss your design choices and discuss the complexity (Big O notation) of your solutions, both memory wise and performance wise. Provide map visualization when relevant\n",
    "    - Try to stick to the most popular scientific Python libraries.\n",
    "    - Use the provided csv files.\n",
    "- For question 2, use map vizualisastion\n",
